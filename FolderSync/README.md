# FolderSync

A command-line folder synchronization tool that performs one-way synchronization from a source directory to a replica directory.

## Features

- One-way synchronization from source to replica
- Copies new files and updates modified files
- Creates necessary directory structure in replica
- Comprehensive logging to both console and file
- Cross-platform path handling
- Error handling

## Usage

```bash
FolderSync --source <source_path> --replica <replica_path>
```

### Arguments

- `--source`: Path to the source directory
- `--replica`: Path to the replica directory

### Example

```bash
FolderSync --source "C:\MyDocuments" --replica "D:\Backup\MyDocuments"
```

## Build Instructions

1. Ensure you have .NET SDK installed
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Build the project:

```bash
dotnet build
```

4. Run the application:

```bash
dotnet run -- --source "path/to/source" --replica "path/to/replica"
```

## Development Status

- âœ… Day 1: Basic one-time sync functionality   

## Technical Details

- Uses iterative directory traversal (stack-based DFS) to avoid recursion issues
- Compares files by size and timestamp for efficiency
- Thread-safe logging with timestamp formatting
- Cross-platform path operations using Path.Combine
